# FastFit
A fast vertex fitter based on the eigen library and the kalman filter aglorithm

This is mostly a test-project for a faster vertex fitter for the Belle II experiment

# Other implementations
The Belle and Belle II experiment employ the following vertex fitter implementations
   * RAVE https://github.com/newtrino/rave
   * KFitter (no online resource)
